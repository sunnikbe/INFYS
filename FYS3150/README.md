# FYS3150 Computational Physics
This course was project-based where we, as a group of two students, completed the projects as a collaboration. 

### Course content: 
(https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/index-eng.html)

This course gives an introduction to numerical methods for solving problems in physics and chemistry, i.e. methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, matrix operations and eigenvalue problems, numerical integration, Monte Carlo methods, and modeling. The course also covers a short and hands-on introduction to programming in C++ and version control with git, and provides training in how to write a scientific report.

### Learning outcome:
After having completed the course:

- you master basic C++ programming for numerical applications, as well as the use of git for version control.
you have basic knowledge of optimization and parallelization of code.
- you can apply a number of numerical methods for eigenvalue problems and matrix operations, ordinary and partial differential equations, integration, and simulation of stochastic systems. Among the methods covered are LU decomposition, the Verlet algorithm, Runge-Kutta methods, the Crank-Nicolson method, Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, and the Metropolis algorithm.
you can account for the strengths and weaknesses of the above numerical methods.
- you have knowledge of applications of numerical methods in different scientific fields.
- you can communicate numerical work by producing a thorough scientific report, written in LaTeX, with associated visualisations and code.
