This course gives a basic introduction to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Through an algorithmic approach, the students are given a practical understanding of the methods being taught, in particular through making their own implementations of several of the methods. The course covers supervised classification based on e.g., artificial neural networks (deep learning), as well as unsupervised learning (clustering), regression, optimization (evolutionary algorithms and other search methods) and reinforcement learning, in addition to design of experiments and evaluation. Students also receive an introduction to philosophical fundamental problems and ethical questions related to ML/AI, as well as the field's history.

### Learning outcome:

After taking the course, you will:

- have insight into the main methods used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)
- have knowledge of the historical development of the field
be able to design and conduct experiments using the methods, with emphasis on evaluation
- be able to consider the pros and cons when choosing ML / AI methods for different applications
- be able to implement algorithms for selected methods
have knowledge of basic philosophical and ethical issues related to the development and application of ML/AI
